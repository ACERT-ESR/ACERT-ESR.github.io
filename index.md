For right now, we just have the [95 GHz Spectrometer documentation](./python-hfesr/index.html)

Also [TRD3 presentation is here](https://files.acert.chem.cornell.edu/f/61f2d37e4a/?raw=1)
and [printable copy is here](https://files.acert.chem.cornell.edu/f/0e07a9db00/?raw=1)

Notes on generation:
This is generated by going into hfesr/docs in the hfesr repository, doing "make html," and 
then running
``git subtree push --prefix hfesr/docs/_build/html origin gh-pages``.
