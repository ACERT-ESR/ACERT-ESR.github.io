For right now, we just have the [95 GHz Spectrometer documentation](./python-hfesr/index.html)

<small>
Notes on generation:
This is generated by going into hfesr/docs in the hfesr repository, doing "make html," and 
then running
``git subtree push --prefix hfesr/docs/_build/html origin gh-pages``.
