For right now, we just have the <a href="./hfesr/index.html">95 GHz Spectrometer documentation</a>
This is generated by going into hfesr/docs in the hfesr repository, doing "make html," and copying the result into the appropriate subdirectory.
In the future, would probably be good to just put that under the gh-pages branch.
