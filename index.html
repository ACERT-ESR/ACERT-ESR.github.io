For right now, we just have the <a href="./hfesr/index.html">95 GHz Spectrometer documentation</a>
<br/>
<br/>

Notes on generation:
This is generated by going into hfesr/docs in the hfesr repository, doing "make html," and copying the result into the appropriate subdirectory.
This directory is currently set with a .nojekyll file to turn off jekyll.

In the future, I should just set up
a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">project repository</a> (a gh-pages branch) as shown
<a href="https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490">here</a>.
