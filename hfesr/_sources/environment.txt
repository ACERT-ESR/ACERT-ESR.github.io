Using Software Versions
-----------------------

Multiple versions of the hfesr software are installed on Maxwell, but only one can be active at a time.  
The name of the current active version is displayed in parenthesis at the beginning of the command prompt::

  (version)[acert@maxwell ~]$

The current stable version is always enabled by default.  When the spectrometer software is launched,
it will correspond to the version displayed on the command prompt.

To select other versions to work on, the "workon" command is provided.  This command is used to list all
available versions, as well as select a specific one to use.

To list all versions, just enter "workon" with no arguments::

  (hfesr6)[acert@maxwell ~]$ workon
  hfesr6
  hfesr_dev
  (hfesr6)[acert@maxwell ~]$

In this example, the current version is "hfesr6", and we see that both "hfesr6" and
"hfesr_dev" are available for use.

To switch versions, enter "workon XYZ" where XYZ is the name of the desired version.  For example::

  (hfesr6)[acert@maxwell ~]$ workon hfesr_dev
  (hfesr_dev)[acert@maxwell ~]$

As you can see from this example, the command prompt changed from the default "hfesr6" to 
the newly selected "hfesr_dev".

Installing Software Versions from Source
----------------------------------------

The source code for the spectrometer software is stored in the directory::

  /home/acert/src/hfesr

Before changes to the source code can be run, they must be installed to a specific named version using the
python installer.  From within the source directory, the installer may be run by executing::
    
    (hfesr_dev)[acert@maxwell hfesr]$ python setup.py install

This will install the spectrometer controller code into the currently selected named version.  In the example above,
this is "hfesr_dev".  It is important to be aware of which version the source is being installed into.   Use
"workon" to chenage the currently selected version if necessary.
